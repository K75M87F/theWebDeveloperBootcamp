<!-- In the next lecture you'll be asked to "Make all inputs have a 3px red border", this should say "Make all inputs (except the checkboxes) have a 3px red border". Checkbox elements cannot be styled directly. If you're wondering how to style them, you can checkout this StackOverflow thread.

Meanwhile, around the 1 minute and 40 second mark Colt mistakenly uses the CSS color property, but he should have used either the background or background-color property. He makes the correction in the solution video. -->
